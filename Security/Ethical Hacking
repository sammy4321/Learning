Here’s a breakdown of each term :

1. Dark Web : Part of the internet that is not indexed by traditional search engines and requires specific software, like Tor, to access. It’s known for hosting illegal activities, but also includes legitimate privacy-focused communication and activism.
2. Network Pentesting : A simulated cyber-attack on a network to find and exploit vulnerabilities before malicious hackers can. This involves scanning, enumeration, and exploitation to assess security weaknesses.
3. Website Pentesting :  Similar to network pentesting, but specifically focused on web applications. It involves testing a website or web application for security flaws like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other vulnerabilities.
4. Network Scanner: A tool that scans a network to discover devices, open ports, and services running. Common tools include Nmap and Advanced IP Scanner. It helps in identifying vulnerabilities and managing network assets.
5. Man-in-the-Middle: An attack where an attacker intercepts and potentially alters communication between two parties without their knowledge. This can allow the attacker to eavesdrop on or manipulate data.
6. Packet Listener: A tool that captures and analyzes network packets. Tools like Wireshark allow security professionals to inspect network traffic for anomalies, security issues, or performance problems.
7. Keylogger: A type of malware or monitoring tool that records keystrokes on a computer or mobile device. It can capture sensitive information like passwords and personal data without the user’s knowledge.
8. Backdoor: A method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls to gain unauthorized access to a system. It’s often installed by attackers after exploiting vulnerabilities or by malware. Backdoors can be used for persistent access and control.

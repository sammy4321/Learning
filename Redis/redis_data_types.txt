Redis supports a variety of data types, each designed to handle different kinds of data structures and use cases. Here’s a summary of the main data types supported by Redis:

1. Strings : 
    Description: The simplest type of value you can store in Redis. A string can contain any kind of data, such as text, numbers, or binary data like images.
    Operations:
    SET key value: Set the value of a key.
    GET key: Get the value of a key.
    INCR key: Increment the value stored at key (assuming it is an integer).
    APPEND key value: Append a value to a key.
2. Lists : 
    Description: A list of strings, sorted by the order in which elements were added. You can think of it as a linked list.
    Operations:
    LPUSH key value: Prepend one or more values to a list.
    RPUSH key value: Append one or more values to a list.
    LPOP key: Remove and return the first element of the list.
    RPOP key: Remove and return the last element of the list.
    LRANGE key start stop: Get a range of elements from the list.
3. Sets : 
    Description: An unordered collection of unique strings. Sets are useful for storing items without duplicates.
    Operations:
    SADD key value: Add one or more members to a set.
    SREM key value: Remove one or more members from a set.
    SMEMBERS key: Get all the members in a set.
    SISMEMBER key value: Check if a value is a member of the set.
4. Sorted Sets (Zsets) : 
    Description: Similar to sets, but every member has an associated score, which is used to order the members.
    Operations:
    ZADD key score member: Add a member to the sorted set with a given score.
    ZRANGE key start stop [WITHSCORES]: Return a range of members in a sorted set, by index.
    ZRANK key member: Determine the index of a member in the sorted set.
    ZREM key member: Remove one or more members from a sorted set.
5. Hashes : 
    Description: A collection of key-value pairs, where the key is a string and the value is a string. It’s like a dictionary or a map in other programming languages.
    Operations:
    HSET key field value: Set the string value of a hash field.
    HGET key field: Get the value of a hash field.
    HGETALL key: Get all fields and values in a hash.
    HDEL key field: Delete one or more hash fields.
6. Bitmaps : 
    Description: Bitmaps are not an actual data type, but they allow you to manipulate individual bits in a string. This is useful for operations like keeping track of user logins by date.
    Operations:
    SETBIT key offset value: Sets or clears the bit at offset in the string value stored at key.
    GETBIT key offset: Returns the bit value at offset.
7. HyperLogLogs : 
    Description: A probabilistic data structure used for counting unique elements in a set with a fixed, small amount of memory. It’s not exact, but it is very memory-efficient.
    Operations:
    PFADD key element: Adds elements to the HyperLogLog data structure.
    PFCOUNT key: Returns the approximate cardinality of the set observed by the HyperLogLog.
8. Geospatial Indexes : 
    Description: Allows you to store and query geographical data, such as latitude and longitude.
    Operations:
    GEOADD key longitude latitude member: Add a geospatial item to a sorted set.
    GEORADIUS key longitude latitude radius unit: Query members within a given radius from a point.
    GEODIST key member1 member2 unit: Returns the distance between two members of a geospatial index.
9. Streams : 
    Description: A log-like data structure that allows you to record an append-only sequence of data and consume it in a flexible way. Useful for message queues.
    Operations:
    XADD key id field value: Append a new entry to a stream.
    XRANGE key start end: Read entries from a stream.
    XREAD COUNT count STREAMS key: Read data from one or multiple streams.
10. Pub/Sub (Publish/Subscribe) : 
    Description: Redis provides a messaging mechanism where publishers send messages to channels, and subscribers receive those messages. While this is not a data structure per se, it's a common use case.
    Operations:
    PUBLISH channel message: Publish a message to a channel.
    SUBSCRIBE channel: Subscribe to a channel to receive messages.
    PSUBSCRIBE pattern: Subscribe to channels that match a given pattern.
11. Transactions : 
    Description: Redis allows for transaction blocks where multiple commands are executed in a sequence without being interrupted. This is not a data type but an important feature to ensure atomicity.
    Operations:
    MULTI: Marks the start of a transaction block.
    EXEC: Executes all commands in a transaction.
    DISCARD: Discards all commands issued after MULTI.
    These data types and structures make Redis versatile for various use cases, from caching and real-time analytics to message brokering and more.

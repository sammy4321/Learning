To accomplish the task of reading data from BigQuery, applying a transformation, and publishing the results to Google Pub/Sub using PySpark, you can follow these steps. This approach will leverage PySpark's ability to directly connect to BigQuery, perform in-memory transformations, and then publish the results to Google Pub/Sub.

Code :

        from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
        from pyspark.sql.functions import col
        import json
        from google.cloud import pubsub_v1

        # Initialize Spark session
        spark = SparkSession.builder \
            .appName("BigQuery to Pub/Sub with PySpark") \
            .config("spark.jars.packages", "com.google.cloud.spark:spark-bigquery-with-dependencies_2.12:0.31.1") \
            .getOrCreate()

        # Set the GCP project ID and the path to the service account key
        project_id = "your-gcp-project-id"
        credentials_path = "/path/to/your/service-account-key.json"

        # Set the configuration for the BigQuery connector
        spark.conf.set("credentialsFile", credentials_path)
        spark.conf.set("parentProject", project_id)

        # Define the BigQuery table to read from
        dataset = "your_dataset"
        table = "your_table"
        bigquery_table = f"{project_id}.{dataset}.{table}"

        # Read the BigQuery table into a DataFrame
        df = spark.read \
            .format("bigquery") \
            .option("table", bigquery_table) \
            .load()

        df.show()

        # Apply a transformation, e.g., filter rows where column "value" > 100 and count occurrences of a specific column
        filtered_df = df.filter(col("value") > 100)

        # Perform a simple aggregation, counting occurrences by a specific column, e.g., "category"
        result_df = filtered_df.groupBy("category").count()

        result_df.show()

        # Set up Pub/Sub client
        publisher = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()
        topic_path = publisher.topic_path(project_id, "your-topic-id")

        # Collect the DataFrame to the driver node (assuming it's small enough to fit in memory)
        results = result_df.collect()

        # Publish each row as a JSON message to Pub/Sub
        for row in results:
            message_json = json.dumps(row.asDict())
            message_bytes = message_json.encode('utf-8')
            future = publisher.publish(topic_path, data=message_bytes)
            print(f"Published message ID: {future.result()}")

        # Stop the Spark session
        spark.stop()

This code block includes:
1. Spark session initialization with the necessary BigQuery connector configuration.
2. Reading data from BigQuery into a Spark DataFrame.
3. Applying transformations to the data.
4. Publishing the transformed data to Google Pub/Sub.

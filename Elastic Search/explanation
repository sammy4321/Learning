Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine designed for horizontal scalability, reliability, and real-time search capabilities. It’s widely used for full-text search, logging, data analysis, and more. Here’s an overview of its core components and features:

Core Components of Elasticsearch : 
1.	Node : 
	•	Definition: A single server that is part of the Elasticsearch cluster. Each node is an instance of Elasticsearch.
	•	Roles: Nodes can have different roles such as master, data, and client nodes, each responsible for specific tasks.
2.	Cluster : 
	•	Definition: A collection of one or more nodes that work together to store and manage data and provide search and analytics capabilities.
	•	Purpose: Provides a distributed environment where data is stored and queries are processed across multiple nodes.
3.	Index : 
	•	Definition: A logical namespace that maps to one or more physical shards. An index stores documents and is analogous to a database in traditional relational databases.
	•	Purpose: Organizes documents in a structured way, allowing for efficient search and retrieval.
4.	Document : 
	•	Definition: The basic unit of information that can be indexed. Documents are stored in JSON format and represent a single piece of data.
	•	Purpose: Contains fields and values, which are indexed for search purposes.
5.	Shard : 
	•	Definition: A basic unit of storage and search functionality within an index. Elasticsearch automatically distributes shards across nodes in the cluster.
	•	Types:
	•	Primary Shard: Holds the original data.
	•	Replica Shard: A copy of the primary shard, used for redundancy and improved search performance.
6.	Replica : 
	•	Definition: A copy of a primary shard. Replicas provide redundancy and improve search performance by allowing parallel search queries.
	•	Purpose: Ensures data durability and high availability.
7.	Mapping : 
	•	Definition: Defines the schema for the documents in an index, including field types and index settings.
	•	Purpose: Controls how data is indexed and stored, influencing search and query behavior.
8.	Analyzer : 
	•	Definition: A component that processes text data during indexing and search. It includes tokenizers and filters.
	•	Purpose: Breaks text into terms (tokens) and applies various transformations, such as stemming and lowercasing, to improve search relevance.
9.	Query DSL : 
	•	Definition: A JSON-based query language used to interact with Elasticsearch. It allows for complex searches and aggregations.
	•	Purpose: Provides a flexible way to construct and execute queries, including full-text search, filtering, and aggregation.
10.	Aggregations : 
	•	Definition: A framework for performing complex data analysis and calculations on indexed data.
	•	Purpose: Allows for operations such as counting, averaging, and summing, enabling powerful data analytics and reporting.
11.	RESTful API : 
	•	Definition: Elasticsearch exposes its functionality through a RESTful API, allowing clients to interact with it using HTTP requests.
	•	Purpose: Provides access to index, search, and manage data using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
12.	Elasticsearch Query Capabilities : 
	•	Full-Text Search: Enables searching across large volumes of text, including support for various search features like relevance scoring and text analysis.
	•	Filtering and Faceting: Allows for precise filtering and categorization of search results.
	•	Real-Time Search: Provides near real-time search capabilities, making it suitable for logging and monitoring applications.
13.	Elasticsearch Stack (ELK Stack) : 
	•	Elasticsearch: The core search and analytics engine.
	•	Logstash: A data processing pipeline that ingests, transforms, and loads data into Elasticsearch.
	•	Kibana: A visualization tool that provides graphical representations of data stored in Elasticsearch.
	•	Beats: Lightweight data shippers that collect and send data to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

Summary : Elasticsearch’s core components work together to provide a powerful, distributed search and analytics platform. Nodes form a cluster that holds indices, which are divided into shards and managed through mappings. Documents are indexed using analyzers, and queries are constructed using the Query DSL to perform sophisticated searches and aggregations. The system is designed for high availability and scalability, making it suitable for a variety of applications from full-text search to real-time data analysis.

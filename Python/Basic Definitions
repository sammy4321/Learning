Methods and Functions : A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called independently of any object. A method is a function that is associated with an object. In object-oriented programming (OOP), methods are functions defined within a class and are intended to operate on instances of that class (objects).
Parameters and Arguments : Parameters are the variables listed in the function or method definition. They act as placeholders for the values that will be passed to the function when it is called. Arguments are the actual values or data you pass to the function when you call it. These values are assigned to the corresponding parameters in the function.

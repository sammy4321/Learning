This code uses the with statement to open a file for reading or writing. The file name is specified as a string, and the mode is specified as a string, which can be one of the following:

r: Open the file for reading (default).
w: Open the file for writing (create a new file if it doesn't exist, or overwrite the existing file).
a: Open the file for appending (add to the end of the file, without overwriting the existing contents).
x: Open the file for exclusive creation (fail if the file already exists).

Also, you can use the write_lines() method to write multiple lines to the file.

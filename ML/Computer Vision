OpenCV : 

- **Blending**: Combining two or more images to produce a single image, typically using weighted averages. 
- **Image Thresholding**: Converting a grayscale image to a binary image by setting pixels above a certain value to one color and below to another. 
- **Blurring**: Reducing noise and detail in an image by averaging pixel values in a neighborhood, commonly using Gaussian or median filters. 
- **Smoothing**: Reducing noise and detail in an image, often through techniques like Gaussian or bilateral filtering. 
- **Gradients**: Measuring the change in intensity or color in an image, often used for edge detection with operators like Sobel or Laplacian. 
- **Histograms**: Graphical representation of pixel intensity distributions in an image, used to analyze contrast and brightness.

Redis is an in-memory key-value store known for its speed, simplicity, and versatile data structures.
1. Data Management in Redis : 
    Key-Value Paradigm: Redis stores data as key-value pairs. Keys are unique strings, while values can be different data structures.
    Commands:
        Set data: SET key value
        Get data: GET key
        Delete data: DEL key
        Check existence: EXISTS key
    Expiration: You can set TTL (time-to-live) on keys:
        EXPIRE key seconds
        TTL key
2. Strings :
    Basics: Store simple strings or binary data. INCR and DECR are to increase or decrease the value if it is an integer. 
    Commands: SET, GET, INCR, DECR, APPEND.
    Example: 
        SET username "alice"
        GET username
        INCR pageviews
3. Lists : 
    Description: Ordered collections of strings, similar to linked lists.
    Commands:
    Add elements: LPUSH, RPUSH
    Retrieve elements: LPOP, RPOP, LRANGE
    Length: LLEN
    Examples:
        LPUSH tasks "task1"
        RPUSH tasks "task2"
        LRANGE tasks 0 -1
4. Hashes : 
    Description: Key-value pairs within a key, like a dictionary.
    Commands:
    Set fields: HSET, HMSET
    Get fields: HGET, HGETALL
    Delete fields: HDEL
    Examples:
        HSET user:1 name "Alice" age 30
        HGET user:1 name
        HGETALL user:1
5. Sets : 
    Description: Unordered collections of unique strings.
    Commands:
    Add elements: SADD
    Check membership: SISMEMBER
    Intersection, union, difference: SINTER, SUNION, SDIFF
    Examples:
        SADD fruits "apple" "banana"
        SISMEMBER fruits "apple"
6. Sorted Sets : 
    Description: Like sets but with a score for ordering elements.
    Commands:
    Add elements: ZADD
    Get range: ZRANGE, ZREVRANGE
    Get score: ZSCORE
    Examples:
        ZADD leaderboard 100 "player1" 200 "player2"
        ZRANGE leaderboard 0 -1 WITHSCORES
7. Pipelining : 
    Description: Group multiple commands to send them in one request, reducing network overhead.
    Usage: Most Redis clients support pipelining.
    Example (Pseudo-code):
        pipeline = redis_client.pipeline()
        pipeline.set('key1', 'value1')
        pipeline.set('key2', 'value2')
        pipeline.execute()

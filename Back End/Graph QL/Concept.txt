1. Schema Definition : GraphQL uses a schema to define the types and operations available (queries, mutations, and subscriptions).
2. Resolver Functions : Resolvers implement the logic for fetching and modifying data based on schema operations.
3. Subscriptions : Subscriptions enable real-time updates for specific events.

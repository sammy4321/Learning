1. Comparison-Based Sorting Algorithms : 
	•	Bubble Sort: Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Simple but inefficient for large datasets.
	•	Selection Sort: Finds the smallest (or largest) element in the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element. Also simple but not very efficient for large lists.
	•	Insertion Sort: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly picking the next item and inserting it into its correct position.
	•	Merge Sort: Divides the list into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. Efficient with a time complexity of O(n \log n).
	•	Quick Sort: Selects a ‘pivot’ element, partitions the list into elements less than and greater than the pivot, and recursively sorts the partitions. Generally efficient with an average time complexity of O(n \log n), though the worst case is O(n^2).
	•	Heap Sort: Converts the list into a heap structure, then repeatedly extracts the maximum (or minimum) element to sort the list. Has a time complexity of O(n \log n).
	•	Shell Sort: Generalization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart. The performance depends on the gap sequence used.

2. Non-Comparison-Based Sorting Algorithms : 
	•	Counting Sort: Counts the occurrences of each distinct element and uses this count to place elements in their correct position. Efficient for small ranges of integers, with a time complexity of O(n + k), where k is the range of the input.
	•	Radix Sort: Sorts numbers digit by digit starting from the least significant digit. Often used with counting sort as a subroutine. Time complexity is O(nk), where k is the number of digits.
	•	Bucket Sort: Distributes elements into buckets based on a certain range, sorts each bucket individually (often using another sorting algorithm), and then concatenates the buckets. Useful when the input is uniformly distributed.

3. Specialized Sorting Algorithms : 
	•	Timsort: A hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort, used in Python’s built-in sort functions. It is designed to perform well on real-world data with a time complexity of O(n \log n) and additional optimizations.
	•	Comb Sort: Improves upon bubble sort by using a larger gap sequence and reducing the gap as sorting progresses. More efficient than bubble sort in practice.
	•	Gnome Sort: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm similar to insertion sort but with a different approach to finding the correct position for elements.

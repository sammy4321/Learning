In Python, __name__ is a special built-in variable that represents the name of the current module. It is part of Python's set of dunder variables (double underscore variables), which are used internally by Python but can also be accessed in your code.

Key Points :
    1. When a Python script is run directly, __name__ is set to '__main__'.
    2. When a Python script is imported as a module in another script, __name__ is set to the module's name.

Running python code : Execution process: When a Python program runs, the interpreter reads the Python source code, parses it, and converts it into an intermediate form (bytecode). This bytecode is then interpreted by a virtual machine (Python Virtual Machine, or PVM) rather than being directly executed by the CPU.

Sample vs Population : 
1. Population Data : A population refers to the entire group of individuals, items, or events that you want to study or analyze. Population data includes all members of this group.
2. Sample Data : A sample is a subset of a population that is selected and studied to make inferences about the entire population. Sampling is done to reduce the cost, time, and resources required to study the entire population.

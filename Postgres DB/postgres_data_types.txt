Here is a list of data types in PostgreSQL:

**Integer Types**

1. `int` (4-byte signed integer)
2. `integer` (4-byte signed integer) (synonym for `int`)
3. `smallint` (2-byte signed integer)
4. `bigint` (8-byte signed integer)
5. `int2` (2-byte signed integer) (synonym for `smallint`)
6. `int4` (4-byte signed integer) (synonym for `int`)
7. `int8` (8-byte signed integer) (synonym for `bigint`)

**Floating-Point Types**

1. `float` (4-byte floating-point number)
2. `float4` (4-byte floating-point number) (synonym for `float`)
3. `float8` (8-byte floating-point number)
4. `real` (4-byte floating-point number) (synonym for `float4`)
5. `double precision` (8-byte floating-point number) (synonym for `float8`)

**Character Types**

1. `char` (fixed-length character string)
2. `varchar` (variable-length character string)
3. `text` (variable-length character string, supports Unicode)
4. `char varying` (variable-length character string) (synonym for `varchar`)
5. `character varying` (variable-length character string) (synonym for `varchar`)

**Bit Types**

1. `bit` (bites of binary data)
2. `bit varying` (variable-length bits of binary data)
3. `boolean` (true or false boolean value)

**Date and Time Types**

1. `date` (date only, no time component)
2. `time` (time only, no date component)
3. `timestamp` (timestamp with time zone)
4. `timestamptz` (timestamp with time zone) (synonym for `timestamp`)
5. `interval` (interval of time between two timestamps)
6. `time with time zone` (time only with time zone) (synonym for `time`)
7. `date time` (date and time) (synonym for `timestamp`)

**Array Types**

1. `text[]` (array of text strings)
2. `int[]` (array of integers)
3. `integer[]` (array of integers) (synonym for `int[]`)
4. `bool[]` (array of boolean values)
5. `date[]` (array of dates)
6. `time[]` (array of times)
7. `timestamp[]` (array of timestamps)

**Composite Types**

1. `record` (composite type created from a struct)
2. `row` (composite type created from a table)

**Other Types**

1. `json` (JavaScript Object Notation)
2. `jsonb` (binary JSON)
3. `xml` (XML data type)
4. `oid` (unique identifier)

Note: This is not an exhaustive list, and PostgreSQL has many more data types and subtypes. Additionally, some data types may have specific attributes or constraints that can be applied.

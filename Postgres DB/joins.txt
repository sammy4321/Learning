Here are some examples of joins in PostgreSQL:

**Inner Join**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders
ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```
This will return all rows from the `customers` table that have a matching `customer_id` in the `orders` table.

**Left Join (or Left Outer Join)**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders
ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```
This will return all rows from the `customers` table, and the matching rows from the `orders` table. If there is no match, the result will contain null values for the `orders` columns.

**Right Join (or Right Outer Join)**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
RIGHT JOIN orders
ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```
This will return all rows from the `orders` table, and the matching rows from the `customers` table. If there is no match, the result will contain null values for the `customers` columns.

**Full Outer Join**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
FULL OUTER JOIN orders
ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```
This will return all rows from both the `customers` and `orders` tables, with null values in the columns where there is no match.

**Cross Join**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
CROSS JOIN orders;
```
This will return the Cartesian product of the `customers` and `orders` tables, with each row of `customers` paired with each row of `orders`.

**Self Join**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers c1
JOIN customers c2
ON c1.customer_id = c2.customer_id;
```
This will return all pairs of customers who have the same `customer_id`.

**Using multiple tables**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
JOIN orders o ON customers.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id;
```
This will return all rows from the `customers` table, along with the matching rows from the `orders`, `order_items`, and `products` tables.

Note that in PostgreSQL, you can also use the `USING` keyword instead of the `ON` keyword to specify the join condition. For example:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders USING (customer_id);
```
This is a shorthand way to specify the join condition, and can make your SQL code more concise.

Schemas : A schema is a container for tables, views, indexes, and other objects. A schema helps to organize and structure the database by providing a way to group related objects together and to isolate them from other schemas.
Schemas can inherit from other schemas, which means that they can inherit the objects (tables, views, indexes, etc.) from their parent schema. This is known as a schema hierarchy.
CREATE SCHEMA my_schema;
CREATE SCHEMA public_schema INHERITS (my_schema);
Objects within a Schema : Tables, Views, Indexes, Sequences, Functions, Procedures, Triggers, Composite types.

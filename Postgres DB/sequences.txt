In PostgreSQL, a sequence is a special kind of database object that is used to generate unique numeric values, typically used for auto-incrementing primary keys. Sequences are very similar to the AUTO_INCREMENT feature in other databases like MySQL, but they offer more flexibility and control.

Key Features of Sequences : 
1. Automatic Incrementing: Sequences automatically generate a unique integer each time they are called. By default, they start from 1 and increment by 1, but these values can be customized.
2. Independent of Tables:Unlike AUTO_INCREMENT in some databases, PostgreSQL sequences are independent objects. They can be associated with multiple tables or used independently for other purposes.
3. Customizable Parameters:You can define the starting point, increment value, minimum value, maximum value, and whether the sequence should cycle when it reaches the maximum value.
4. Concurrency-Safe:Sequences are designed to be used safely in a concurrent environment, ensuring that each session gets a unique value even when multiple sessions are requesting a new sequence value simultaneously.

Creating a Sequence :
CREATE SEQUENCE sequence_name
  START WITH 1
  INCREMENT BY 1
  MINVALUE 1
  MAXVALUE 9223372036854775807
  CACHE 1;

Using Sequence : 
SELECT nextval('sequence_name'); - To get next value
SELECT currval('sequence_name'); - To get current value without incrementing
SELECT setval('sequence_name', new_value); - To set sequence to a specific value. 


Using sequence with tables : 
CREATE SEQUENCE user_id_seq START WITH 1000 INCREMENT BY 1;
CREATE TABLE users (user_id INT DEFAULT nextval('user_id_seq'), username TEXT);

Apache Airflow is a platform for orchestrating complex workflows and data pipelines. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the key concepts:

1 DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph): The core concept in Airflow. It represents a workflow where tasks are defined and their execution order is specified. Each DAG defines how tasks depend on each other.
2. Task: A single unit of work within a DAG. Each task is defined using an operator and performs a specific function, like running a script or querying a database.
3. Operator: A template for defining tasks. Operators come in various types, such as BashOperator for executing bash commands, PythonOperator for running Python functions, and SqlOperator for executing SQL queries.
4. Task Instance: An instance of a task in a specific DAG run. It represents the execution of a task and contains information like its state and execution time.
5. Scheduler: The component responsible for triggering DAG runs based on the schedule you define. It decides when each task should be executed.
6. Executor: Manages the execution of tasks. Different types of executors (e.g., SequentialExecutor, LocalExecutor, CeleryExecutor) provide different levels of parallelism and scalability.
7. Hook: A mechanism for interacting with external systems (like databases or cloud services). Hooks encapsulate the logic needed to connect and interact with these systems.
8. Sensor: A special type of operator used to wait for a certain condition to be met. For example, a FileSensor might wait until a file appears in a directory.
9. Connection: Stores credentials and configuration details for connecting to external systems and services. Connections are used by hooks and operators to interact with these systems.
10. Variable: Allows you to store and retrieve values that can be used across tasks and DAGs. Useful for managing configuration and runtime parameters.
11. XCom: Short for "Cross-Communication". It allows tasks to share data by passing messages or results between them.
12. Airflow UI: The web-based interface for managing and monitoring your workflows. It allows you to view DAGs, track the status of tasks, and troubleshoot issues.
13. Airflow is designed to be flexible and extensible, making it suitable for a wide range of data engineering and workflow automation tasks.

First Define a DAG, then tasks by passing this dag as variable(Operators are used for these DAGs), then set dependencies between tasks(Basically order of tasks).

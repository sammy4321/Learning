Flow : 
1. Send auth data to server. Could be username and password. 
2. Server checks if auth data is correct.
3. Server sends back a token.
4. Client stores token.
5. Client sends token with every request.
6. Server checks if token is valid. Only that server can check if the token is valid. Token is created using some JSON data and signature. Signature is created using a key stored on the server. So JSON data + Signature = JWT.
